## Instagram_clone_project
### Introduction
To setup this project, you need to follow this instruction. 
1. Connect to your own database and mail account.
- You can find back-end code in master branch. That's done by Spring boot. If you get used to the framework, you must understand what I meant. Otherwise, go to 'application.properties' file and repalce some settings with yours.
2. Make storage on your computer for Server.
- I didn't use Image host server. Instead I get Server to save images in local directory. Go to 'FileUploadServiceImpl' file in back-end code and check two variables named 'uploadProfileFolderPath' and 'uploadPostFolderPath'. That's the pathname for folders where images will be saved. You have to make your own folders and put the pathname on there.
